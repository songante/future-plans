# future-plans
this repository should introduce the reader to my plans for creating articles
And so, a number of major robotics competitions have recently been held. The author of the article is amazed by the number of people using ready-made modules. We will create a number of articles on the topic of making modules with our own hands, some of them will be published in different languages. That's all for now
